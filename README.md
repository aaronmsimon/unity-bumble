# Bumble

A game where you control a bumbling bee.

## Ideas
- try to collect pollen
- enemies block you
- boss idea: bird
- at random intervals, Bumble will go out of control
- maybe Bumble is invisible when goes out of control
- maybe a way to anticipate/use this direction
- upgrades? control when he goes out of control/end points/number of curves/etc

### Control
